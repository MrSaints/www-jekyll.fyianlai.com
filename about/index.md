Hello! My name is Ian, and welcome to my personal website.

I'm an autodidact, full-stack web developer (minus mobile development) who is currently based in London. I'm also recent graduate in BSc. International Relations.

As a self-proclaimed, full-stack web developer _(or a web unicorn, to borrow from contemporary startup lingo)_, I've amassed approximately 10+ years worth of experience working in both backend, and in frontend web development.

As of August 2015, my preferred programming language of choice is Golang. I have however, worked extensively with PHP, JavaScript _(often in CoffeeScript)_, Ruby, and most recently, Elixir as well as Clojure(Script) among many others. I'm currently exploring Elm, and Crystal.

I have an immense love for planning, building, testing, and shipping web applications of any scale.

My passion for the web is partly guided by my innate desire to discover, learn, and tinker ("hack"). The attainment of once unfamiliar knowledge is extremely gratifying, and being able to solve existing / future challenges with newfound knowledge is empowering. As the saying goes: _"knowledge is power"_.

Outside the realm of web development, I have a multitude of interests. These interests includes international relations _(my undergraduate degree)_, applied psychology, astronomy _(particularly, aerospace)_, and machine learning.
